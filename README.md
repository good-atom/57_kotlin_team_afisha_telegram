# 57_kotlin_team_afisha_telegram
57 school kotlin team project. Gladyshev Daniil, Faleev Alex, Laskina Alice 
The project is a Telegram bot built with Kotlin that helps users find events and places to spend their evening, such as concerts, theaters, exhibitions, restaurants, and other activities. Users can select a city and apply filters for category, date, price, etc. The bot will then show a list of suitable events with descriptions, images, and links to ticket purchases. Additionally, users can like artists, venues, and categories of events to receive personalized recommendations in the future. The bot will send reminders about events for which users have purchased tickets and allow them to set their preferred time for notifications. The overall goal is to provide users with an easy and enjoyable way to discover events, tailored to their individual interests and preferences.
